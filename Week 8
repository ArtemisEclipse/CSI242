Passcodes: Whisper and Lux
Participation: I attended office hours for help trying to figure out game stuff
Self-Directed Learning: Looked at some stuff on rpg dev in kaboom
Project Update: I think I'm going to have to overhaul the code. How I'm building the levels right now has limits and can be improved. Will hopefully have a cleaner project to show you on Tuesday/Friday.
