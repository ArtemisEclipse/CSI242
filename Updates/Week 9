Passcodes: Bakufu and Sekigahara
Participaton: I had my camera on in both lectures. That was all I did.
Self Directed Learning: None
Project Update: I had a bad week. Like turbo bad mental. I took a break this week. I am not happy about it but it is what it is. I did not attend office hours because I had nothing to show.
                I should be back on track this week and will hopefully have something to show to you. Also for some reason I never saw the final project proposal assignment. I sent you a 
                message on canvas about my proposal on Thursday, but only just made the post for the assignment today on Sunday really sorry about that.
