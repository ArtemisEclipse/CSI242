Passcodes: Tennis Ball and Tyrannosaurus Rex(T-Rex)
Participation: This week I think I failed to meet 2 participation requirements. I attened class in person on Thursday and had my camera on in zoom on Tuesday. However, I do
               think I asked or answered any questions this week. I was at office hours on Tuesday but I found the answer to my question myself. On Wednesday we had our 1 on 1 
               meeting and I don't believe that counts for participation, but it did occur during office hours.
Self Directed Learning: I have finished the self directed learning for codecademy. However, the website would not allow me to do the quiz or two projects for functions without
                        paying for them so I did not do those.
Project: I finished up my website Sunday morning. I would have like to committed more time to it and been fancier with it. It meets all rubric requirements but it feels weak. I
         hope it's aesthetic is ok. I am not going to pretend I am artsy or understand the color wheel, but I think it is ok.
Extra Credit: I attended our 1 on 1 meeting this week on Wednesday and we had a great chat!
