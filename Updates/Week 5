Passscodes: Chariot and I somehow did not get the day 2 passcode despite being there :(
Participation: I had my camera on in zoom meetings and I attended office hours on Friday
Self Directed Learning: I will be learning how to make a 2D platformer this week from a YouTube tutorial for our next project
Project Update: The calculator is done. I could not get the negative button right, but I do feel like I did pretty good for my first real project overall
