Lecture PassCodes: Starship and Eclipse (Fun fact my in-game names include the word Eclipse because I think it is cool)
Participation: I had my camera on during zoom lectures and attended office hours to ask about event listeners and the calculator project
Self Directed Learning: I have not done any at this time but I do have YouTube tutorials I would like to look in to.
Project Update: I have added mostly pseudo code to the calculator project to lay down a framwork for how I want it to work (and because I could not get event listeners working)
                I plan to hopefully have most of it coded before Friday office hours to be able to talk about it and have any issues or questions resolved before it is due.
